# General-Assembly-Projects
In this repository you can find all the projects I completed over the course of 3 months during my Data Science bootcamp.
The first project (project-1-v2-starter-code.ipynb) was related to data structures: creating various data structures 
and working with them.
The second project (project-02-v2-starter-code.ipynb) was dedicated to the various steps of Exploratory Data Analysis.
Project 3 was when we first attempted linear regression and classification. Using housing data from the city of Ames, 
the ultimate goal of this project was to attempt to predict house prices using various characteristics. 
Web-scraping was first introduced in the 4th project when I was asked to predict the average salary of a Data Scientist 
using data scraped from Indeed.com. This way, after gathering data scraped from the website I had to reproduce everything 
that I had learned previously. 
Finally, my capstone project was dedicated to using deep-learning algorithms to try to forecast Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. 
In a second part of the project, I used Natural Language Processing on data from Twitter and Bloomberg data to try and analyse 
Economic sentiment over time. Combining findings from both parts, I managed to provide valuable insights regarding the 
volatility of these cryptocurrencies and the influence of the public opinion and politics on them.
